<h1>User pictures synchronisation</h1>

<p>If your learning administration management system stores pictures for users, this tool let you 
	get them synchronized in Moodle. The action of this tool is to automatize through cron 
	the standard interactive function Administration &gt; Users &gt; Accounts &gt; "Upload user pictures" from standard 
	Moodle administration.</p>
	
<p>To synchronize user pictures, you need get pictures within a compressed archive. You can choose which
	identifying attribute is to be used to match users with images. Image file names will comply the 
	folowing construction rule:</p>

<p><pre>&lt;%valueid%&gt;.gif ou &lt;%valueid%&gt;.jpg</pre></p>

<p>The zip file can be droped into the %%dataroot%%/sync directory by your administration application, and should use a discriminating
	 filename prefix that you will mention in the userpictures_fileprefix setup parameter. Files are processed in the directory
	 alphabetic order. Thus you can sequence the processing of several picture files, providing appropriate filenames...</p>

<p>Example :</p>
<p><pre>userpictures_20111201.zip
userpictures_20111202.zip
userpictures_20111203.zip
...
</pre></p>

<h3>Archiving and cleanup</h3>
<p>Picture files will be archived after processing if the global archiving option is enabled. Optionally, original files will be discarded, 
	if the global cleanup feature is enabled, or if the special user picture cleanup forcing option is enabled.
</p>

<h3>Automated execution and reporting</h3>
<p>User pictures synchronisation will be processed after user synchronisation. When croned, the user picture report is added to the general 
	scheduled report.</p>
